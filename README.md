# CMDcal

## Summary

CMDCal is a small, command-line operated, appointment scheduling application built in a single Bash file. It makes use of the [Dialog](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dialog) library for the GUI, and saves all appointment data in a plain-text file called 'save.txt'. I built this for my CS224 class (currently in college) and am putting it here for street cred!

### Features
- Schedule an appointment (date, time, reason) //add pic of calander
- View/Edit/Delete appointments //add pic of view appointments screen
- View today's appointments //add pic


Feel free to download and change as much as you'd like! Code is commented per requirments of my professor.
